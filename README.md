## CodeForces_RoadMap (Java)
This repository will contain Ladder Map(or Road Map) to start or improve on Codeforces platform in Java language.

### The Ladder Map

### About The Folders
There are some segregated questions(rank wise) which anyone must solve inorder to increase or to openup the rank at codeforces platform.

### List 
1. __Contest Folders__ - There will be contest folders with their code inside them.
2. __ProblemSet Folder__ - This folder will store the questions from the problemset bank on codeforces just to practice.
3. __Ladder11 Folder__ - This folder is basically the first ladder for beginners, unrated users or users with Codeforces Rating < 1300. and will store generally 3 __Level__ folders
4. __Level Folder__ - This folder will contain source of various problems with the particular difficulty level (Level - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
5. .........to be continued

### Note : 
Some codes are available in cpp language because Java code failed due to Time Limit Exceeded.
